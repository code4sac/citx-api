The Citizen Experience (CITX) API
========

The Citizen Experience API is a Ruby on Rails application to orient civic information around categories and topics that people care about rather than the fragmented structure of government. We will use it to aggregate information about government and nonprofit departments, programs, annual budgets, performance indicators, and services. The goal is to iteratively refine the models until they can serve as data standards to make these complex civic systems more interoperable, and empower engaged citizens, policymakers, and journalists with better tools for decision-making.
